- **v2.4.1** - 2025/02/?? -Corrected a bug in Reader for otherseasons=2; Corrected a bug in plotmodel.
- **v2.4** - 2025/02/10 - Automatic detection of existing installation of VBMicrolensing at build time; Output of failing subprocesses shown for easy error detection; Bug correction in automatic cleanup of preliminary models; Lower boundary of q decreased to 1.e-7; Refinement of offset degeneracy calculation; New function in plotmodel to convert from fitting parameters to conventional orbital elements; plotmodel includes limb darkening in calculation of residuals.
- **v2.3** - 2024/11/28 - Update to VBMicrolensing 4.1.2; minor bug in re-normalization; additional accurate initial conditions for planetary events; check each binary-lens fit for offset degeneracy; changed maximal steps in each parameter in LevMar; a few bugs corrected in covariance reports; ellipsoid increased by delta chi square and more accurate check of duplicates in model selection; models above Wilks' theorem trheshold are removed in Finalizer; accuracy option in plotmodel; source trajectory and caustic in templates.show_template(). 
- **v2.2** - 2024/10/25 - Replaced VBBinaryLensing with VBMicrolensing; Added the possibility to constrain fits;  possibility to choose model categories to fit; possibility to make just a quick update to previously found models; added Keplerian orbital motion for binary lenses as model category "LK"; partial implementation of static triple-lenses, triple-lenses with parallax; optimization of ModelSelector excluding higher chi square models from check; possibility to cleanup event directory from preliminary models, thus saving 99% disk space.
- **v2.1.1** - 2024/09/11 - Re-ordering peaks in InitCond to promote peaks appearing in more datasets.
- **v2.1** - 2024/09/04 - recover_options function; noparallax replaced by onlyorbital everywhere; InitCond prints peaks found; All peaks used for single-lens-single-source initial conditions; Templates package to manage template library; Time limit for LevMar now forced by RTModel; Possibility to start fit from user-defined initial conditions through an array or a file; plotmodel: figure, showlightcurve, showcaustics.
