- **v2.2.0** - 2024/10/25 - Replaced VBBinaryLensing with VBMicrolensing; Added the possibility to constrain fits;  possibility to choose model categories to fit; possibility to make just a quick update to previously found models; added Keplerian orbital motion for binary lenses as model category "LK"; partial implementation of static triple-lenses, triple-lenses with parallax; optimization of ModelSelector excluding higher chi square models from check; possibility to cleanup event directory from preliminary models, thus saving 99% disk space.
- **v2.1.1** - 2024/09/11 - Re-ordering peaks in InitCond to promote peaks appearing in more datasets.
- **v2.1** - 2024/09/04 - recover_options function; noparallax replaced by onlyorbital everywhere; InitCond prints peaks found; All peaks used for single-lens-single-source initial conditions; Templates package to manage template library; Time limit for LevMar now forced by RTModel; Possibility to start fit from user-defined initial conditions through an array or a file; plotmodel: figure, showlightcurve, showcaustics.
- **v2.0.7** - 2024/07/23 - Corrected a bug in ModelSelector showing up for events with a single dataset; corrected a minor bug in re-using old models for PS category.
- **v2.0.6** - 2024/06/10 - Corrected a few bugs on satellites and initial conditions
- **v2.0** - 2024/04/10 - First public release
