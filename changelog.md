- **v3.1** - 2025/08/21 - Upgraded to VBMicrolensing 5.3: parallax calculations based on lookup table. Corrected a bug in LevMar and removed an ambiguous reference for compilation in c++23. Slight revision of bumping mechanism. Corrected small bug in plotmodel.
- **v3.0** - 2025/06/19 - Astrophotometric fits and Image-constrained fits with deep re-structuring of the whole code. Possibility to change parameters ranges in fits; possibility to fit for binary systems with dark companions or change mass-luminosity-radius relations. plotmodel updated with plots for centroid trajectory. A few bugs corrected in Reader, with peak season identified by consecutive positive deviations.
- **v2.4.2** - 2025/05/08 - Corrected a bug causing hanging in the call to InitCond for nostatic.
- **v2.4.1** - 2025/04/26 - Corrected a bug in Reader for otherseasons=2; satellite datasets only end up with numbers; Corrected a bug in plotmodel.
- **v2.4** - 2025/02/10 - Automatic detection of existing installation of VBMicrolensing at build time; Output of failing subprocesses shown for easy error detection; Bug correction in automatic cleanup of preliminary models; Lower boundary of q decreased to 1.e-7; Refinement of offset degeneracy calculation; New function in plotmodel to convert from fitting parameters to conventional orbital elements; plotmodel includes limb darkening in calculation of residuals.
- **v2.3** - 2024/11/28 - Update to VBMicrolensing 4.1.2; minor bug in re-normalization; additional accurate initial conditions for planetary events; check each binary-lens fit for offset degeneracy; changed maximal steps in each parameter in LevMar; a few bugs corrected in covariance reports; ellipsoid increased by delta chi square and more accurate check of duplicates in model selection; models above Wilks' theorem trheshold are removed in Finalizer; accuracy option in plotmodel; source trajectory and caustic in templates.show_template(). 
- **v2.2** - 2024/10/25 - Replaced VBBinaryLensing with VBMicrolensing; Added the possibility to constrain fits;  possibility to choose model categories to fit; possibility to make just a quick update to previously found models; added Keplerian orbital motion for binary lenses as model category "LK"; partial implementation of static triple-lenses, triple-lenses with parallax; optimization of ModelSelector excluding higher chi square models from check; possibility to cleanup event directory from preliminary models, thus saving 99% disk space.
- **v2.1.1** - 2024/09/11 - Re-ordering peaks in InitCond to promote peaks appearing in more datasets.
- **v2.1** - 2024/09/04 - recover_options function; noparallax replaced by onlyorbital everywhere; InitCond prints peaks found; All peaks used for single-lens-single-source initial conditions; Templates package to manage template library; Time limit for LevMar now forced by RTModel; Possibility to start fit from user-defined initial conditions through an array or a file; plotmodel: figure, showlightcurve, showcaustics.
- **v2.0.7** - 2024/07/23 - Corrected a bug in ModelSelector showing up for events with a single dataset; corrected a minor bug in re-using old models for PS category.
- **v2.0.6** - 2024/06/10 - Corrected a few bugs on satellites and initial conditions
- **v2.0** - 2024/04/10 - First public release
